Practice: Add a dedicated task-completion-speed collection to evaluate whether routing prefers the shortest viable completion path under time-sensitive intents.

Why it worked:
- Speed-oriented cases isolate “fast path vs over-engineered path” decisions that generic collections may not expose.
- Coverage includes quick read/search/edit/notify/reminder flows, ensuring broad tool surface under speed pressure.
- The collection integrated without availability drift, preserving clear diagnostics.

Outcome:
- Foundation suite expanded to `13/13` collections and `334/334` cases.
- Speed layer stabilized at `20/20`.
