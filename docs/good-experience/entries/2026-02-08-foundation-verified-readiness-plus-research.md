Practice: Add a dedicated SWE-bench Verified readiness collection to low-cost offline routing eval, then pair it with an explicit submission-policy research note to avoid engineering-only optimization blind spots.

Why it worked:
- New readiness collection increased software-fix routing coverage without introducing online-model cost.
- One failing case was resolved quickly by tightening lexical intent wording instead of changing evaluator logic.
- Research doc captured non-technical submission gates (post-2025 policy), preventing wasted effort on technically strong but non-submittable runs.

Outcome:
- Foundation suite expanded to 7 collections and 214 cases, stabilized at `214/214`.
- Team now has a concrete Verified submission checklist plus fallback path guidance.
