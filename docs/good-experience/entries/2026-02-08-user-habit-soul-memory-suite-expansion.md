Practice: Add a dedicated user-habit + soul + memory continuity collection instead of assuming generic memory cases are sufficient.

Why it worked:
- Preference/persona continuity cases exposed routing risks that generic memory retrieval metrics can miss.
- Mixed chains (memory -> clarify/request_user -> execution/reporting) validated realistic behavior boundaries.
- A single failing case was resolved by removing lexical ambiguity, preserving evaluator stability.

Outcome:
- Foundation suite expanded to `12/12` collections and `314/314` cases.
- User habit and soul continuity now has explicit `20/20` regression visibility.
