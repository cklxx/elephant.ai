Practice: Expand offline foundation eval as a capability matrix (tool coverage, prompt effectiveness, proactivity, complex tasks, availability recovery, valuable workflows, verified readiness, orchestration, safety policy), and close failures by surgical intent disambiguation.

Why it worked:
- Matrix-style collections exposed coverage gaps by capability domain instead of mixed-case noise.
- Incremental expansion with rerun loops made bad-case ownership clear and remediation fast.
- Keeping `availability_errors=0` while scaling case volume preserved confidence that failures were semantic ranking issues, not registration gaps.

Outcome:
- Foundation suite reached `9/9` collections and `254/254` cases.
- Added two system-level dimensions (`multi_step_orchestration`, `safety_boundary_policy`) for ongoing regression control.
