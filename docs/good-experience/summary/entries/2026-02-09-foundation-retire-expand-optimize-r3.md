Summary: Increased challenge pressure by retiring easy explicit intents and expanding conflict-heavy implicit hard sets, then recovered routing via targeted heuristic convergence.
Impact: Suite expanded to `608` cases with final `pass@1=526/608`, `pass@5=608/608`, failed cases=`0`, and deliverable good improved to `33/44`.
