Summary: Product-side semantic convergence on prompts and tool boundaries improved implicit routing precision without reducing pass@5 reliability.
Impact: Foundation suite moved from `pass@1=387/420` to `389/420`, kept `pass@5=420/420`, and reduced top1 misses from `33` to `31` with full lint/test pass.
