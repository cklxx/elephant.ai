Summary: Canonical tool-surface convergence plus scaled layered suites produced stable routing diagnostics and full Top-K pass at larger coverage.
Impact: Expanded evaluation now reports clear `x/x` progress while preserving zero availability failures, making iterative bad-case optimization faster and less ambiguous.
