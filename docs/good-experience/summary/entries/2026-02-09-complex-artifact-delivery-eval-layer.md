Summary: Added a dedicated complex artifact-delivery evaluation layer with deliverable contracts, per-case contract checks, and good/bad sampled report diagnostics.
Impact: Foundation suite expanded to `19/19` and `493/493` pass@5, while exposing delivery-quality split (`23/32` good, `9/32` bad) instead of only routing pass rates.
