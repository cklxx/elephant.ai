Summary: Switched from case-by-case tuning to conflict-cluster-driven pass@1 optimization and formalized the evaluation workflow as a reusable skill/template.
Impact: Expanded suite to `20` collections / `529` cases and improved pass@1 to `446/529` (from `398/505`) while keeping pass@5 at `529/529`.
