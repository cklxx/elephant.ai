# Plan: confirm Lark M0 (Calendar+Tasks) and sync README

Date: 2026-02-03

Goal: confirm the M0 Calendar+Tasks closed loop is implemented and update public docs (README + Lark roadmap notes) to match the repo state.

Steps:
1) Audit code paths and tests for Lark Calendar/Tasks tools, scheduler reminders, and Lark card UX.
2) Resolve doc inconsistencies between `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` and draft Track 3 notes.
3) Update README (EN/ZH) to explicitly document Calendar+Tasks capabilities and scheduler reminder config.
4) Run full lint + tests and ship via incremental commits.

Progress log:
- 2026-02-03: plan created; audit completed.
