## Scope
- Review `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` against drafts + audit notes.

- Produce a review with top priorities and suggested deprioritization.

## Plan
1. Read roadmap + draft + audit; list gaps/mismatches that affect priority.
2. Apply 80/20 prioritization to identify the smallest set that unlocks the closed loop.
3. Draft review output with ordered priorities, risks, and defer list.

## Progress
- [x] Step 1: Source review completed.
- [x] Step 2: 80/20 priority set defined.
- [x] Step 3: Review output prepared.
