Status: Completed

## Scope
- Review `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` Done/Completed entries against repo code paths.
- Identify missing/renamed/migrated paths with repo evidence only.
- Provide corrected paths and status recommendations.

## Steps
1. Locate all Done/Completed entries and extract code paths.
2. Validate each path in the repo and map to current locations.
3. Report mismatches with evidence and recommended updates.

## Notes
- Evidence limited to repo contents; no external assumptions.
