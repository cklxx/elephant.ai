# Plan: Backend architecture issues analysis (2026-01-26)

## Goal
- Continue the backend architecture analysis with concrete, evidence-backed issues and prioritized recommendations.

## Pre-checks
- Reviewed `docs/guides/engineering-practices.md`.

## Scope
1. Capture structural signals (LOC hotspots, dependency fan-out/in).
2. Inspect high-fanout/high-LOC packages for responsibility sprawl and layering risks.
3. Document prioritized issues + recommendations in a reference doc.
4. Update `docs/REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` with new backend issues.

## Deliverables
- New backend architecture issues review under `docs/reference/`.
- Updated refactor ledger with newly identified items.

## Progress
- 2026-01-26: Plan created; engineering practices reviewed.
- 2026-01-26: Captured LOC + dependency fan-out signals; recorded prioritized issues and recommendations in `docs/reference/BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE_ISSUES.md`; updated `docs/REFACTOR_LEDGER.md`.
