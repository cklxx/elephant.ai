context:
  goals:
    - "Deeply research harder industry benchmark families and map them into agent-routing evaluation collections."
    - "Rebuild a systematic multi-dimension end-to-end suite with clear capability layers."
    - "Run end-to-end evaluation and review current delivery capability with pass@1/pass@5 and deliverable quality."
  constraints:
    - "Keep configuration examples in YAML only."
    - "Mark unavailable tools as N/A (not failure) but keep strict evaluation for available-tool intents."
    - "Preserve maintainability by reusing existing dataset schema and report conventions."
