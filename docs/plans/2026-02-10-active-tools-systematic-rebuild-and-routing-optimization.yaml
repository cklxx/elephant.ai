context:
  goals:
    - "Delete or retire evaluation scenarios that depend on unavailable tools in current default toolset."
    - "Build a larger, harder, systematic suite using only currently available tools."
    - "Improve product routing precision for top failure clusters instead of only tuning evaluation files."
    - "Produce complete x/x report with bad case breakdown and good/bad deliverable sampling."
  constraints:
    - "Toolset is default (14 active tools), mode web, preset full."
    - "Unavailable tools are N/A and should be excluded from active baseline suites."
    - "Use YAML for datasets/suites and docs under plans/analysis/research."
