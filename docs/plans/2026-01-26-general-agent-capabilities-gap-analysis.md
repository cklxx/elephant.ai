# Plan: General agent capabilities & gap analysis (2026-01-26)

## Goal
- Research general agent capabilities, compare against current ALEX project, and define test cases + verification strategy.

## Pre-checks
- Reviewed `docs/guides/engineering-practices.md`.

## Scope
1. Compile a capability taxonomy for general agents using primary sources (papers + official docs).
2. Map current ALEX capabilities from repo docs to that taxonomy.
3. Identify capability gaps and missing evaluation coverage.
4. Propose a concrete test case matrix + verification approach (unit/integration/e2e/benchmark).

## Sources (planned)
- ReAct, SWE-bench, WebArena, Mind2Web, WebShop, GAIA, AgentBench, OSWorld, tau-bench, Agent-SafetyBench, RoTBench/StableToolBench.
- Official tool-use docs from OpenAI and Anthropic.

## Progress
- 2026-01-26: Plan created; engineering practices reviewed.
- 2026-01-26: Collected primary sources on agent capabilities/benchmarks; drafted capability taxonomy, gap list, and test matrix/verification approach.

## Deliverables
- Written research summary with citations.
- Gap list relative to ALEX current capabilities.
- Test case matrix + verification guidance.
