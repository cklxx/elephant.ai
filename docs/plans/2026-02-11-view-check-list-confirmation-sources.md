# Plan: Locate low-risk view/check/list confirmation sources

## Goal
Identify where explicit low-risk view/check/list intents are being steered into confirmation-first behavior in prompts/persona/policies/routing and datasets, then propose minimal fixes.

## Steps
- [x] Load repo practices and recent memory summaries.
- [x] Scan persona/prompt/policy/routing sources and datasets for confirmation guidance.
- [x] Produce minimal file list with line-referenced change suggestions.

## Notes
- Focus on read-only explicit intents and confirmation routing/phrasing sources.
