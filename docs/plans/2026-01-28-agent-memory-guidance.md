# Plan: Add memory loading guidance to AGENTS.md (2026-01-28)

## Context
- Need explicit guidance for agents to load memory on first run.
- Memory sources should include error and good experience entries.
- Ordering should consider recency, frequency, and relevance; disclosure should be progressive.

## Plan
1. Update AGENTS.md with a memory section describing folder layout and first-run load steps.
2. Define sorting heuristics (recency, frequency, relevance) and tie-breaking.
3. Document progressive disclosure rules and on-demand retrieval.
4. Run full lint + tests.

## Progress
- 2026-01-28: Plan created.
- 2026-01-28: Updated AGENTS.md with memory loading, ranking, and progressive disclosure guidance.
