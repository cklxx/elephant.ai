# Plan: Trim AGENTS.md to essentials

Date: 2026-01-30
Owner: cklxx assistant

## Goals
- Keep only the most important or frequently needed repo rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Remove verbose memory/best-practice sections while preserving critical constraints.

## Steps
- [x] Review repo engineering practices (`docs/guides/engineering-practices.md`).
- [x] Draft a concise `AGENTS.md` focusing on critical invariants and recurring guidance.
- [x] Update plan status after edits.
- [x] Run full lint + test validation.
- [x] Commit in multiple batches (plan doc, AGENTS update).

## Notes
- Run `claude -p` in the background before executing plan steps.
