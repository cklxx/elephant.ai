**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Status**: Completed
**Author**: cklxx

## Scope
- Review the most recent plan docs (top 3-5 by date) and map each plan to the current code state.
- Identify gaps between plan design and implementation.
- Evaluate testability (unit/integration/e2e coverage and missing cases).

## Plan
1. List recent plan files and select 3–5 for review.
2. For each plan, extract intended changes, status, and acceptance criteria.
3. Trace corresponding code paths and tests; check for missing pieces or misalignments.
4. Summarize gaps + testability risks; propose next steps.

## Progress Log
- 2026-01-31: Plan created; collecting plan files and related code paths.
- 2026-01-31: Reviewed attachment/memory/wechat plans against implementation; lint + test executed.
