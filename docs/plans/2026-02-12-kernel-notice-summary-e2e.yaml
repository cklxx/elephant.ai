status: completed

summary: >
  Improve kernel cycle notifications so /notice group output includes a complete
  task completion summary per cycle, then verify with a real non-mock kernel run
  that STATE.md/INIT.md/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md and cycle outputs are updated as expected.
scope:
  in:
    - Extend kernel cycle notification text with complete completion summary fields
    - Add/adjust notifier unit tests for success/partial/failure/error cases
    - Execute a real kernel single-cycle run using actual runtime config and dependencies
    - Verify state markdown artifacts and runtime block updates end-to-end
  out:
    - Rebuilding Lark gateway notification transport
    - Redesigning kernel planner/executor architecture

    description: Run unit tests and execute one real kernel cycle for end-to-end validation
    status: completed
acceptance_criteria:
  - Notice text contains cycle_id, status, total/success/failed counts, completion rate, failed agents, and duration
  - Kernel notifier unit tests pass with exact expected output
  - Real kernel cycle updates ~/.alex/kernel/default/STATE.md runtime block
  - INIT.md and SYSTEM_PROMPT.md exist and reflect current startup snapshot
notes:
  - Real validation should avoid mock components and use existing runtime defaults.
  - 2026-02-12: Executed real RunCycle with runtime config, produced cycle_id run-wNWp3RJkJhWv, and verified STATE.md/INIT.md/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md updates in ~/.alex/kernel/default.
