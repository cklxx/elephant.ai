# Plan: General agent eval dataset inspection and layering guidance

- Review `evaluation/agent_eval/datasets/general_agent_eval.json` for schema, fields, and task coverage.
- Summarize task types, domains, and difficulty distribution.
- Propose baseline vs challenge split criteria and sampling strategy.
- Recommend judging criteria and scoring rubric aligned to expected outputs.
- Provide any dataset hygiene suggestions (field additions, tags, or metadata).
