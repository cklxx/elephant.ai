# Plan: Architecture & performance review (2026-01-26)

## Goal
- Provide an updated assessment of architecture and performance hotspots with concrete, prioritized recommendations.

## Pre-checks
- Reviewed `docs/guides/engineering-practices.md`.

## Scope
1. Scan file sizes and package boundaries for architectural strain.
2. Identify concurrency, JSON, and memory hotspots.
3. Summarize risks and propose next-step refactors with priority tiers.

## Progress
- 2026-01-26: Captured file size distribution and hotspot counts; documented findings and recommendations.
