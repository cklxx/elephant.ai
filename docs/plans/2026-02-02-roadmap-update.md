# Plan: Roadmap completion review + draft merge

Owner: cklxx
Date: 2026-02-02

## Goal
Review roadmap completion status, merge draft roadmap structure/details into `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`, and add evaluation-set construction items.

## Steps
- [x] Review current roadmap + draft materials; identify completion/status deltas to reflect.
- [x] Update `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` with draft sections (cross-track, dependencies, progress log) and new evaluation-set item.
- [x] Re-review roadmap settings and adjust wording/statuses for accuracy.
- [ ] Run full lint + tests (lint failed on existing issues; `make test` terminated after extended run).
- [x] Restart dev environment (`./dev.sh down && ./dev.sh`).
- [ ] Commit in incremental steps.
