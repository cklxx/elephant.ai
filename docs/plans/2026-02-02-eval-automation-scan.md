# Plan: Eval Automation Scan

## Goal
Identify current evaluation automation (scripts, CI workflows, docs) and determine where to integrate a new evaluation set + judging flow.

## Steps
1. Inventory eval-related scripts, workflows, and docs (scripts/, evaluation/, .github/workflows, docs/).
2. Summarize current pipeline (entrypoints, configs, inputs/outputs, CI triggers).
3. Map integration points for new evaluation set + judging flow and note required artifacts/locations.

## Status
- [x] Step 1: Inventory eval-related scripts/workflows/docs.
- [x] Step 2: Summarize current pipeline.
- [x] Step 3: Map integration points for new eval set + judging flow.
