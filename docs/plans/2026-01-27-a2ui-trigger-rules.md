# A2UI Trigger Rules + Templates (2026-01-27)

## Goal
Increase A2UI trigger coverage so the agent proactively emits UI for flowcharts/forms/dashboards/cards/galleries using on-demand templates.

## Plan
1. Add an A2UI templates skill with concrete patterns for flowchart, form, dashboard, info cards, and gallery.
2. Add static context trigger rules so the agent auto-loads the skill and emits A2UI when UI intent is detected.
3. Run full lint + tests.

## Progress
- [x] Add A2UI templates skill
- [x] Add A2UI trigger rules to context
- [x] Lint/test
