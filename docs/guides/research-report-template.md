Use this template for research-heavy requests (e.g., market or stock research). Keep it concise but complete.

## Research Report Template
1) **Intent & Scope**
   - Restate the user’s goal in one sentence.
   - Specify the exact scope (entity, time window, market, geography).
   - List constraints and success criteria.

2) **Plan (Multi-round Retrieval)**
   - Round 1: broad discovery (sources, baseline facts).
   - Round 2: deep dives (primary filings, authoritative data, opposing views).
   - Round 3 (if needed): validation and gap-closure.

3) **Evidence Table**
   - Source → key data → date → relevance.
   - Note any conflicts or uncertainty.

4) **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Connect evidence to the user’s goal.
   - Explain drivers, risks, and scenarios.
   - Highlight what is known vs. unknown.

5) **Recommendation / Next Steps**
   - Clear recommendation(s) with trade-offs.
   - What to monitor next and why.

6) **Appendix (Optional)**
   - Extra charts, links, or raw notes.
