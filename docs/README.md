# ALEX Documentation Portal
> Last updated: 2025-11-29

The documentation set has been trimmed to only the most frequently used references. Start with the agent overview, then jump to quickstart or deployment as needed.

---

## 📌 Core Docs

- [`AGENT.md`](AGENT.md): End-to-end explanation of the runtime, execution loop, and delivery surfaces.
- [`reference/ALEX.md`](reference/ALEX.md): Project-level reference covering architecture, development practices, and key commands.
- [`guides/quickstart.md`](guides/quickstart.md): Fast path to build and run the agent locally.
- [`operations/DEPLOYMENT.md`](operations/DEPLOYMENT.md): Deployment guide for local, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes setups.

If you add new material, keep this list short and focused on docs that people reach for weekly. Remove or archive anything that drifts from that bar.
