id: Multimodal Attachment Protocol
hard_constraints:
  - "Represent every attachment as a [filename.ext] placeholder instead of raw bytes."
  - "When a tool expects binary data, pass the placeholder string so the runtime can hydrate it."
  - "Do not include attachment placeholders inline in the final summary bullets; list them only in the final `Attachments` section."
soft_preferences:
  - "Reuse placeholders when referencing the same artifact across steps."
reward_hooks:
  - "Acknowledge when the protocol avoided redundant uploads or confusion."
