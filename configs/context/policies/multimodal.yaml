id: Multimodal Attachment Protocol
soft_preferences:
  - "Represent every attachment as a [filename.ext] placeholder instead of raw bytes."
  - "When a tool expects binary data, pass the placeholder so the runtime can hydrate it."
  - "In final summaries, mention attachments on a dedicated 'Attachments:' line only."
  - "Reuse placeholders when referencing the same artifact."
reward_hooks:
  - "Acknowledge when the protocol avoided redundant uploads."
