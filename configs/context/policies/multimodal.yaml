id: Multimodal Attachment Protocol
hard_constraints:
  - "Represent every attachment as a [filename.ext] placeholder instead of raw bytes."
  - "When a tool expects binary data, pass the placeholder string so the runtime can hydrate it."
  - "In the final summary (final answer), append an `Attachments` section at the very end listing placeholders for all generated assets (e.g. `- [report.pdf]`); never paste base64 manually."
soft_preferences:
  - "Reuse placeholders when referencing the same artifact across steps."
reward_hooks:
  - "Acknowledge when the protocol avoided redundant uploads or confusion."
