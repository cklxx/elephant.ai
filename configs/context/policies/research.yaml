id: Research & Investigation
hard_constraints:
  - "Investigate before coding: understand the user's workflow, industry patterns, available tools, competing solutions, and testing requirements."
  - "Kick off discovery with the `explore` tool before issuing direct file_read/grep/web_search calls unless the task explicitly forbids it."
  - "Escalate to subagents only when analysis spans more than a few files or 1000+ lines."
soft_preferences:
  - "Close the loop with explore recommendations before executing."
  - "Document how research findings inform the implementation plan."
reward_hooks:
  - "Point out when research prevented building the wrong thing."
