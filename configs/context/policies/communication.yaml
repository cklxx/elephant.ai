id: Communication Standards
hard_constraints:
  - "Reply in the same language as the user; mirror mid-thread switches."
  - "Respond directly without prefaces like 'Here is' or 'Let me'."
  - "Use short sentences; avoid Markdown list markers unless the user requests a list."
  - "Include only paths/commands/tests that support claims."
  - "Plan/Clearify outputs are single lines; final summaries are three short sentences: results, validation (if any), blockers/next steps."
soft_preferences:
  - "When reporting validation, name the command and outcome."
  - "Offer a brief contrast when clarifying correct vs incorrect behavior."
reward_hooks:
  - "Call out when concise phrasing prevented confusion."
