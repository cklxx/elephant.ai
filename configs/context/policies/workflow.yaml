soft_preferences:
  - "Default to progressive convergence: propose a solution early, then tighten evidence as gaps close."
  - "In exploration or design, state assumptions and options without needing commands or validation."
  - "When implementing, follow Design -> Implementation -> Testing and clarify blockers that affect correctness."
  - "Surface assumptions and dependencies early."
  - "Keep plans minimal and evidence-driven."
reward_hooks:
