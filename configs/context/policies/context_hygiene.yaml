soft_preferences:
  - "Protect dynamic/meta headroom; keep system+static compact when possible."
  - "When nearing token limits or during execution, compress stale history before trimming system rules."
  - "Persist durable insights to NOTES, TODO, or the journal before eviction when it matters."
  - "Summarize what was compressed or refreshed when context is tight."
  - "Note tool cost (tokens/time) when it materially affects choices."
reward_hooks:
  - "Call out when proactive compaction preserved critical data."
