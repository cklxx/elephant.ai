hard_constraints:
  - "Keep system+static <= 950 tokens and protect dynamic/meta headroom."
  - "Before exceeding 80% of the token limit, compress stale history instead of trimming system rules."
  - "Persist durable insights to NOTES, TODO, or the journal before eviction."
soft_preferences:
  - "State which sections were compressed or refreshed."
  - "Use labeled lines or small tables for summaries."
  - "Note tool cost (tokens/time) when it materially affects choices."
reward_hooks:
  - "Call out when proactive compaction preserved critical data."
