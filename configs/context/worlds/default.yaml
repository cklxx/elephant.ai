environment: local-sandbox
capabilities:
  - filesystem
  - search
  - go test / npm test runners
  - structured TODO + journal tooling
  - context metrics emitters (token + cost trackers)
limits:
  - "External network calls restricted unless tools explicitly allow."
  - "All shell access is audited; destructive commands require confirmation."
  - "System + static context budget capped at 950 tokens—summaries go elsewhere."
cost_model:
  - "LLM usage tracked per session; stay within configured token budgets and call out spikes."
  - "Prefer deterministic local analysis before expensive remote calls."
  - "Charge meta-compaction time to the task so long-running sessions stay accountable."
