  category: planning
  intent: Split this migration into phases with explicit checkpoints and risks.
  expected_tools:
  - plan
- id: tool-clarify-blocking-requirement
  category: clarification
  intent: A key requirement is missing and blocks implementation; ask a precise clarifying
    question first.

  - clarify
- id: tool-request-user-verification
  category: handoff
  intent: Continue only after the user completes manual account verification.
  expected_tools:

  intent: Use selectors to fill the login form and click submit on the active page.
  expected_tools:
  - browser_dom
- id: tool-browser-action-canvas-click
  category: browser
  intent: This canvas has no stable selectors; use coordinate-based click and drag
    actions.
  expected_tools:
  - browser_action
- id: tool-browser-info-session
  category: browser
  intent: Inspect current browser tab URL, title, and viewport state before testing.

- id: tool-browser-screenshot-proof
  category: browser
  intent: Capture a screenshot of the current page as visual debugging evidence.
  expected_tools:

- id: tool-read-source-file
  category: workspace
  intent: Open a source file and inspect its content around a suspicious function.
  expected_tools:
  - read_file
- id: tool-list-workspace-directory-ambiguous-scope
  category: workspace
  intent: Before touching anything, quickly inventory candidate paths under service
    and infra roots, including nested dirs, but do not open file contents yet.
  expected_tools:
  - list_dir
- id: tool-search-symbol-occurrences
  category: workspace
  intent: Search symbol occurrences across project files using a pattern.
  expected_tools:
  - search_file

  category: workspace
  intent: Replace deprecated endpoint strings in one file with the new API path.
  expected_tools:

- id: tool-web-search-authoritative-prioritization
  category: web
  intent: Need newest primary references first (RFC/vendor docs), not blog summaries;
    discover which official pages should be cited.
  expected_tools:
  - web_search
- id: tool-web-fetch-single-source-grounding
  category: web
  intent: We already chose one source URL; pull only that page body for grounded wording
    checks and avoid broad search.
  expected_tools:
  - web_fetch
- id: tool-html-edit-transform
  category: web
  intent: Edit an HTML snippet according to transformation instructions and validate
    output.
  expected_tools:
  - html_edit
- id: tool-render-mermaid
  category: visualization
  intent: Render this Mermaid graph into an image artifact.
  expected_tools:
  - diagram_render
- id: tool-artifacts-write-report-with-delivery-constraint
  category: artifact
  intent: Response must stay concise in-chat, but full technical deep-dive must be
    delivered as a reusable file artifact for downstream review.
  expected_tools:
  - artifacts_write
- id: tool-artifacts-list-run
  category: artifact
  intent: List artifacts generated in this run before selecting one to send.
  expected_tools:
  - artifacts_list
- id: tool-artifacts-delete-stale
  category: artifact
  intent: Delete stale artifacts that are no longer needed.
  expected_tools:
  - artifacts_delete
- id: tool-artifact-manifest-read
  category: artifact
  intent: Inspect the artifact manifest including metadata and attachment records.

  category: artifact
  intent: Generate a slide deck from selected image attachments.
  expected_tools:
  - pptx_from_images
- id: tool-memory-search
  category: memory
  intent: Search memory notes for past architecture decisions on auth routing.
  expected_tools:
  - memory_search
- id: tool-memory-get
  category: memory
  intent: Open a memory note and read exact lines for citation.
  expected_tools:
  - memory_get
- id: tool-lark-send-message
  category: lark

    thread so stakeholders see latest status.
  expected_tools:
  - lark_send_message
- id: tool-lark-upload-file
  category: lark
