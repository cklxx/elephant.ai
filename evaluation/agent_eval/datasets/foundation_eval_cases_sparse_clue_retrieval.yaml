description: Sparse-clue retrieval and source-selection stress set inspired by BrowseComp-like
  information-seeking difficulty patterns
scenarios:
- id: sparse-clue-approved-url-direct-ingest
  category: sparse_clue_source_selection
  intent: The ticket already stores a single approved link; pull that page body directly
    without reopening discovery.
  expected_tools:
  - web_fetch
- id: sparse-clue-authoritative-source-first
  category: sparse_clue_source_selection
  intent: We only have vague topic hints and no trusted source yet; shortlist canonical
    primary references before reading details.
  expected_tools:
  - web_search
- id: sparse-clue-memory-vs-repo-search
  category: sparse_clue_memory_repo_conflict
  intent: Need the person's prior decision preference pattern before proposing action;
    codebase lookup is irrelevant at this step.
  expected_tools:
  - memory_search
- id: sparse-clue-memory-note-selected-open-lines
  category: sparse_clue_memory_repo_conflict
  intent: The relevant memory note has already been identified; open exact fragments
    for citation-grade wording.
  expected_tools:
  - memory_get
