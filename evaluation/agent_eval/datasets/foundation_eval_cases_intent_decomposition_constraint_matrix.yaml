  selection, execution mode, scheduling semantics, and deliverable routing
scenarios:
- id: opt-hard-consent-before-external-task-sync
  category: consent_gate_disambiguation
  intent: Policy says no external coordination until user confirms; ask for approval

  intent: Action depends on sensitive personal context and cannot proceed safely without
    explicit user confirmation.
  expected_tools:
  - request_user
- id: opt-hard-plan-phase-vs-task-update
  category: planning_vs_mutation_boundary
  intent: Define phased rollout plan with milestones, rollback gates, and risk checkpoints
    before any task updates.
  expected_tools:
  - plan
- id: opt-hard-plan-minimal-sequence
  category: planning_vs_mutation_boundary
  intent: Provide the smallest viable staged execution sequence with explicit checkpoints.
  expected_tools:
  - plan
