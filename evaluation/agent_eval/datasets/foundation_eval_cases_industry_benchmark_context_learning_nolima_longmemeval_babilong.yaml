    category: "nolima_transfer"
    intent: "Given a memory hint ID, open only the exact stored fragment to avoid hallucinated interpolation."

    category: "nolima_transfer"
    intent: "Two long-context constraints conflict subtly; ask one precision clarification before execution."

    category: "longmemeval_transfer"
    intent: "Need to reconstruct decision chronology from prior thread turns before generating the final answer."
